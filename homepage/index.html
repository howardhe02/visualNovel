			<h1>Description Of Our Project</h1>
			<p>
				Our project will be a story based, anime dating simulator game which will make the player choose a character to date and have fun with throughout the story.
				In the story, there are multiple occasions where you will have to visit and spend time with your date(such as a carnival fair). In these sections of the game, you will have to fit their needs, win prizes in a game, and satisfy their mood through the decisions you make in conversation with them. There will be many interactable cutscenes and paths to take to make the game more diverse for each new time you play. Make the wrong decision and you could spend the worst time of your life. Make the right decisions and you could marry the person of your dreams. The choice is yours.
